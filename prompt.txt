I want to build Knowledge Graph RAG application using Langchain, 
Ollama, Neo4J Graph Database, where the user can upload structured and unstructured data .txt, .json, .pdf in the Streamlit UI and query it with natural language. Some details are as follows,

Build Knowledge Graphs
Construct graph representations from structured and unstructured data
Use NetworkX for graph manipulation and visualization
Migrate graphs to Neo4j for persistence and querying
Extract entities and relationships from text using LLMs
Implement Graph RAG
Create hybrid search combining vector and graph capabilities
Write graph queries using the Cypher query language
Build vector indices over graph nodes
Combine semantic search with graph traversal
I have attached a plan that summaries what we aim to build,

Following the architecture diagram above, we'll create a complete graph RAG system that:

Constructs an initial knowledge graph from structured hotel data
Enriches the graph with entities extracted from unstructured text
Stores the graph in Neo4j with vector embeddings
Implements hybrid search combining graph and vector capabilities
Evaluates and compares different RAG approaches

Constructs an initial knowledge graph from structured data (.txt, .json, .csv)
Enriches the graph with entities extracted from unstructured text (.pdf, )
Stores the graph in Neo4j with vector embeddings
Implements hybrid search combining graph and vector capabilities
Sreamlit Web UI - Two colmun app with a sidebar. Left column display the knowledge graph cosntruted from the data along with st dataframe that shows the table for structured data. Right column where user will run query
I want to share this project with other in github so lets start with a requirement.txt and project structure in README.md
